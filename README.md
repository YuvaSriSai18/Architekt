## 🧠 System Design Playground

**System Design Playground** is an interactive web-based tool that helps learners **understand and practice computer science concepts** — especially **System Design** — through a **visual, drag-and-drop interface**.
Instead of learning theory passively, users can *build real-world system architectures*, configure components, and visualize how data flows across distributed systems.

---

### 🚀 Features

* **🧩 Drag & Drop Components:**
  Add and connect system components like Load Balancers, Databases, Caches, API Gateways, Queues, etc. using an intuitive node-based canvas.

* **⚙️ Configurable Properties:**
  Each component supports custom configurations — for example, load balancer algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections), database replication, or cache eviction policies.

* **🔗 Interactive Data Flow:**
  Draw connections between components and visualize how requests move through the architecture.

* **📊 Real-Time Simulation (Upcoming):**
  Simulate request flow, latency, and scaling behavior under different load conditions.

* **🤖 AI-Powered Explanation (Planned):**
  Get instant insights and suggestions from an AI assistant that explains how your system works and how it can be optimized.

* **💾 Save & Share Designs:**
  Save your architectures to the cloud or export them as images or JSON for collaboration.

### 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Flow
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
* **AI Engine:** Gemini API
* **Auth & Hosting:** Firebase + Vercel

### 🎯 Vision

> To make learning **System Design** and **Distributed Systems** *hands-on and visual*, enabling students and engineers to grasp complex infrastructure concepts by building and experimenting — not just reading.

---

### 💡 Example Use Cases

* Build a scalable “Instagram-like” architecture.
* Visualize how caching reduces database load.
* Experiment with load balancing strategies.
* Learn how queues improve fault tolerance and decoupling.
